# TriangleTester
A simple program that will determine the type of a triangle. It should take the lengths of the triangle's three sides as input, and return whether the triangle is equilateral, isosceles or scalene. The program throws Exception if invalid input is given such as non-positive side lengths or invalid triangle length (none of the side should be greater than sum of other 2 sides).
